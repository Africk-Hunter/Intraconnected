## V 1.03.11 — Mobile Fixes — 2026-06-22
- All mobile FAB buttons (help, patch notes, navigate, create, edit) animate their icon on active state (scale up + lift); patch notes and navigate buttons also change background color
- Mind map sheet entry animation now radial-pops from click origin (same as help/patch notes sheets)
- Mind map sheet and help sheet bottom edge repositioned to clear the FAB bar instead of overlapping it
- Sass `lighten()` → `color.adjust()` deprecation fix in `idea.scss` and `mobileMindMap.scss`; overlay uses `100dvh` fallback

## V 1.03.10 — EVEN MORE POLISH (I guess?) — 2026-06-22
- Checklist items can now have individual links (optional `link` field on `ChecklistItem`); link button in hover controls on desktop card, desktop modal, and mobile sheet; linked items render as `<a>` tags; Firebase encryption/decryption updated to handle item links
- Delete confirm modal pop animation now originates from the trash can position instead of cursor; idea name clamped to 4 lines to prevent oversized names from breaking the modal
- Mind map tree resets collapse state on close (remounted via `treeKey`); node button max-width increased 160→240px with overflow clipping
- Mobile sheet container uses `max-height: 80dvh` + `overflow: hidden` to fix content bleed on dynamic viewport heights
- `IdeaNode` `isHidden` simplified from `useState` to a derived value

## V 1.03.9 — POLISHING DIS SHII — 2026-06-21
- All desktop modals (Rename, Delete, Link, Checklist, Creation) now use `AnimatedOverlay` for pop-in/out animations keyed from click origin
- Mind map always rendered in DOM (opacity/pointer-events toggle); auto-centers on current idea node on open; zoom now pivots around cursor position
- Checklist nodes display inline as read-only cards in the desktop mind map
- Desktop mid-section fades out (opacity transition) instead of unmounting when mind map opens; navbar create button and depth holder fade similarly
- Mobile header title converted to editable textarea (inline rename, saves on blur)
- Mobile sheet and help/patch notes pop animations changed from slide-up to radial-pop from click origin
- Mobile rename sheet input upgraded from `<input>` to auto-growing `<textarea>`
- Mobile checklist sheet edit input upgraded from `<input>` to auto-growing `<textarea>`
- Mobile navigate button animation: icon scales up and inverts on active state
- Help badge colors corrected: nav badge → teal, edit badge → yellow
- Help sheet back button styled consistently (orange, reduced padding)
- `TooltipButton` accepts `wrapperClassName` prop for hiding the wrapper div

## V 1.03.8 — Mind Map Line Fix — 2026-06-21
- Fixed collapse toggle line extending past '+' circle when children are hidden
- Consistent vertical line centering across all mind map connectors

## V 1.03.7 — SEO & Polish — 2026-06-20

## V 1.03.5 — Checklist Item Drag & Edit — 2026-06-20

## V 1.03.4 — Icon Refresh & Help Polish — 2026-06-20
- New skinny icon variants across mobile FAB area (MindMap, Open, PatchNotes, Plus); navigate and patch notes buttons colored teal and yellow
- Help screens polished: checklist badge uses real CSS checkbox, patch notes shown as real button, node type order fixed
- Bug fix: `rootIdStack` no longer double-pushes root on re-render

## V 1.03.3 — Expanded Help & Streamlined Onboarding — 2026-06-19
- Help carousel expanded from 3 to 5 screens (desktop + mobile)
- Desktop screens 4–5: Mind Map overview, depth dots + patch notes
- Mobile screens 3–5: checklist node type, Navigate button, edit mode + patch notes
- Recovery code screen removed from signup/migration/restore flows — users go straight to `/main`

## V 1.03.2 — Polish & UX Improvements — 2026-06-19
- Added Privacy Policy page (`/privacy` route, link on auth screen)

- Two-layer key scheme: DEK wrapped by password-derived KEK + recovery KEK + email KEK
- Recovery code flow: generated on first login, shown once, acknowledged flag stored in Firestore
- Email recovery: unwrap DEK using email-derived KEK (no email sent; Firebase Auth ownership = proof)
- DEK persisted in `sessionStorage` across page reloads; cleared on sign-out
- `enc:` prefix on ciphertext for backward-compatible migration of legacy plaintext
